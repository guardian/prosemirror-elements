# @guardian/prosemirror-elements

This Prosemirror plugin adds the ability to add custom 'elements' to a document.

## Why does this exist?

Modelling non-text content in Prosemirror can be tricky. `prosemirror-elements` provides an abstraction that makes it easy to write custom elements that:

- contain user-defined fields that model many different kinds of content, including rich text fields and arbitrary data
- are first class citizens of the Prosemirror schema (for example, nested rich text fields play nicely with collaborative editing)
- are renderer-agnostic (we use React as a default)

## Setup

`yarn` installs and sets up the project dependencies.

## Run

1. Ensure nginx is running.
2. `yarn start` builds the project locally, spins up a webserver on http://localhost:7890, and watches for file changes.

## Testing

- Run the unit tests via Jest with `yarn test:unit`.
- Run the integration tests via Cypress with `yarn test:integration`.
  - You'll need to be running the application via `yarn start` simultaneously for the tests to work â€“ make sure the server is responding on http://localhost:7890 before running the tests.
  - For reasons we're not yet able to determine, Cypress won't run your tests immediately when you select them in the GUI. Hit the 'refresh' button and they should run normally.

## Releasing

This repository uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to publish new versions of this package when PRs are merged to `main`, and prelease versions when code is pushed to `beta`.

Version numbers are determined by the commit history of main, and so to trigger a release you'll need to use the [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen) format when naming pull requests. Then, when the PR is merged via a merge commit, the name of that commit (which corresponds to the name of the PR) will trigger a release.

For example, merging a PR named:

- `fix: this one weird bug` to `main` will trigger a release with a patch version bump
- `feat: an exciting new thing` to `beta` will trigger a release with a `beta` suffix and a minor version bump

### Testing locally in applications using `prosemirror-elements`
We've found yalc useful in testing local changes to prosemirror-elements in applications that use it.

Setup: 

1. Install `yalc` globally with `npm i yalc -g` or `yarn global add yalc`.
2. Run `yarn yalc` in your local project from your current branch, to build to project and push changes to yalc.
3. Run `yalc add @guardian/prosemirror-elements` within the project consuming prosemirror-elements locally.

Note: any changes you make to your local prosemirror-elements branch must be republished (step 3). Don't forget to run `yarn yalc` again!
