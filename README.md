# @guardian/prosemirror-elements

This Prosemirror plugin adds the ability to add custom 'elements' to a document.

## Why does this exist?

Modelling non-text content in Prosemirror can be tricky. `prosemirror-elements` provides an abstraction that makes it easy to write custom elements that:

- contain user-defined fields that model many different kinds of content, including rich text fields and arbitrary data
- are first class citizens of the Prosemirror schema (for example, nested rich text fields play nicely with collaborative editing)
- are renderer-agnostic (we use React as a default)

## Setup

`yarn` installs and sets up the project dependencies.

## Run

1. Ensure nginx is running.
2. `yarn start` builds the project locally, spins up a webserver on http://localhost:7890, and watches for file changes.

## Testing

- Run the unit tests via Jest with `yarn test:unit`.
- Run the integration tests via Cypress with `yarn test:integration`.
  - You'll need to be running the application via `yarn start` simultaneously for the tests to work â€“ make sure the server is responding on http://localhost:7890 before running the tests.
  - For reasons we're not yet able to determine, Cypress won't run your tests immediately when you select them in the GUI. Hit the 'refresh' button and they should run normally.

## Releasing

This repository uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to publish new versions of this package when PRs are merged to `main`, and prelease versions when code is pushed to `beta`.

Version numbers are determined by the commit history of main, and so to trigger a release you'll need to use the [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen) format when naming pull requests. Then, when the PR is merged via a merge commit, the name of that commit (which corresponds to the name of the PR) will trigger a release.

For example, merging a PR named:

- `fix: this one weird bug` to `main` will trigger a release with a patch version bump
- `feat: an exciting new thing` to `beta` will trigger a release with a `beta` suffix and a minor version bump


## Troubleshooting when developing this library

### Problems with `yarn link`

ProseMirror and its dependencies sometimes use object identity checks (e.g. `instanceof`). When using `yarn link`, it's possible for the consuming code to bundle different versions of dependencies simultaneously. This can be difficult to work around. It will not happen during a normal install.

One known instance of this occurs when appending the `NodeSpec` generated by the library to the parent editor schema. This would normally be accomplished by appending it to a parent schema, like so:

```ts
const mySchema = new Schema({
  nodes: OrderedMap.from(schema.spec.nodes).append(nodeSpec),
  marks
});
```

This may fail if your bundler has included the `ordered-map` dependency twice in your project. Because `ordered-map` uses `instanceof` to determine if an incoming object is an `OrderedMap`, the incoming object will fail this check, despite it being the correct shape.

As a workaround, try reconstructing the map as an object:

```ts
const objectNodeSpec: Record<string, NodeSpec> = {}
nodeSpec.forEach((key, value) => objectNodeSpec[key] = value as NodeSpec);

const mySchema = new Schema({
  nodes: OrderedMap.from(schema.spec.nodes).append(objectNodeSpec),
  marks
});
```
